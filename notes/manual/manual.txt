[[ Basic TCP Server Hosting ]]
-- Klehrik

--------------------

[[ GETTING STARTED ]]

The only object required is "obj_NetworkManager".

To create a server or client, first create an instance
of "obj_NetworkManager" and assign it as follows:

1 |  // Init
2 |
3 |  net = instance_create_depth(0, 0, 0, obj_NetworkManager);

You will be able to access the networking functions through this as follows:

1 |  var ping = net.get_ping();

--------------------

[[ VARIABLES ]]

The following variables (located at the top of "obj_NetworkManager"'s Create Event) can be modified:

timeout (default = 5)
* The time (in seconds) that a client will spend attempting to connect to a server.
* The client will also automatically disconnect if a ping is not sent back within this time.

pingFrequency (default = 2)
* The time (in seconds) between a client's automatically sent pings.

bufferDefaultSize (default = 32)
* The default size (in bytes) for data packets sent over the network.

bufferInt (default = buffer_s32)
* The size used for integers in data packets.

bufferFloat (default = buffer_f32)
* The size used for floats in data packets.

[[ FUNCTIONS ]]

create_server(port, maxClients)
* Create a new server with the given port limited to a set number of clients.
* (The server itself does not count as a client, so for a four player game, set maxClients to 3.)

destroy_server()
* [Host only] Destroy the server if it is up.

join_server(ip, port)
* Join an existing server with the given IP address and port.
* Returns "false" if the connection failed.

leave_server()
* [Client only] Leave the current server.

is_connected()
* Check if this instance is connected.

is_host()
* Check if this instance is the host.

is_client()
* Check if this instance is a client.

get_client_count()
* [Host only] Get the number of connected clients.

send_ping()
* [Client only] Send a ping to the server.
* (This function is automatically called by all clients in set intervals.)

get_ping()
* [Client only] Get the ping (in ms) of this client.

instance_create_network(x, y, obj)
* Create an instance that is also created on the server/all other clients.

instance_sync_variables(id, {variables...})
* Sync an instance's given variables with the server/all other clients.
* All arguments provided after "id" will be treated as variables to be synced.
* NOTE: Variable names must be provided as strings (etc. "image_blend").

instance_host_to_local(id)
* [Client only] Matches an instance's ID on the server to the same instance on this client.
* Returns "-1" if the instance cannot be found.
* (This function is automatically used in instance_sync_variables() and has little use anywhere else.)

instance_local_to_host(id)
* [Client only] Matches an instance's ID on this client to the same instance on the server.
* Returns "-1" if the instance cannot be found.
* (This function is automatically used in instance_sync_variables() and has little use anywhere else.)
