# Basic TCP Server Hosting
Basic implementation of server hosting with TCP in GameMaker Studio 2 that handles all of the networking stuff, including creating an instance on the server/all clients and being able to sync instances' variables with a single function, as well as clients automatically pinging the server and disconnecting if the server closes.

A MANUAL.txt file is included.
