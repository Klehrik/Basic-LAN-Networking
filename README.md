# Basic LAN Networking for GameMaker Studio 2
Basic implementation of LAN networking with TCP in GameMaker Studio 2 that handles all of the networking stuff, including creating an instance on the server/all clients and being able to sync instances' variables with a single function, as well as clients automatically pinging the server and disconnecting if the server closes.

A MANUAL.txt file is included in notes/manual.
